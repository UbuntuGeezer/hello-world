# hello-world
Repository of esoteric anomalies discovered in the lre-learning curve of Linux world open-system coding in the 21st century.

About ME: A "has-been" systems analyst from Control Data's heyday in the late 60's and 70's; left off software development about
20 years ago after a brief stint as an embedded systems programmer using C++ and VB on Windows system variants. The "coderman" took
a rest in the interim, having been completely frustrated with Microsoft's stranglehold on the industry and the exponetial growth of
software that sucks. IMHO Borland was the all-star of PC software development platforms. Their old C++ and Object Oriented
Programmming manuals were the best I ever saw in my entire career, even to date. Their Paradox database system was the most
user-friendly and intuitively robust system I ever used. Phillipe Kahn has my continued admiration.

About This. It has been a learning curve to get back into OOP with the newest developments in languages and tools, but I have
uncovered some interesting "behaviors" of the languages and classes as I claw my way back in. This repository is my way of sharing
coding samples that have been illuminating along the path of discovering 21st century application coding in the Linux world. It is
intended to be of interest to both novice and developer alike, as I tend to deviate from "normal" application development while
pursuing in-depth study of a new universe of knowledge. I welcome feedback and critquing, but only after the initial volatile "I'm
right!" defense mechanism. Hopefully, you can find some of my errant assumptions laughable as you read my code.
